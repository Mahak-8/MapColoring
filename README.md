# MapColoring
###### Implemented and compared the results from 4 different map coloring algorithms.
* Simple Backtrack
* Backtrack with Forward Check
* Maintaining Arc Consistency
* Local search

## Input Format
###### The first 3 algorithms take the dimensions and matrix values as input(For reference: input.txt)
###### Local search takes an extra parameter "Maximum steps" as input(For reference: input_mc.txt)

## Output Format
###### The first 3 algorithms gives the node and its corresponding color code as output(For reference: output.txt)
###### Local search gives an extra parameter "Steps taken for coloring" (For reference: output_mc.txt)

## Observations
###### For detailed comparison of the four algorithms along with time complexity, please refer Results.pdf
