###### Implemented and compared the results from 4 different map coloring algorithms.
* Simple Backtrack
* Backtrack with Forward Check
* Maintaining Arc Consistency
* Local search

## Input Format
###### The first 3 algorithms take the dimensions and matrix values as input(For reference: input.txt)
Local search takes an extra parameter "Maximum steps" as input(For reference: imput_mc.txt)
